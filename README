Add XHProf easing to your Diem project.


Abstract :

  XHProf is a php profiling extension.
  This extension has been created by Facebook alongside with their HipHop PHP-to-C++ compiler.
  
  This extension can create PNG call-graphs of the execution of your requests.
  (For this, you need graphviz installed & configured)

- Installation

  . Read http://techportal.ibuildings.com/2009/12/01/profiling-with-xhprof/ to install XHProf on you server
  
  . For all your symfony applications, you have to edit the filters.yml in /apps/$app/config/filters.yml.
    Add these two lines just after execution: ~
--
dm_xhprof:    
  class: dmXhProfFilter
--

  So you file will look like this :
  
--
rendering:    ~

remember_me:  ~

security:     ~

dm_init:      ~
  
cache:        ~

dm_xhprof:    
  class: dmXhProfFilter

execution:    ~
--
  
  This will make the dmXhprof filter being executed at first.



- Configuration

  In your app.yml (on both applications), you have to add some configurations:
  
--
all:
  xhprof: 
    enabled: true
    level: 2
    
dev:
  xhprof:
    outputlink: true

prod: 
  xhprof:
    outputlink: false
--
 
 
- How it works

  The filter does all the job :
    - it looks if it has been enabled in app.yml
    - if so, it registers a listener for the sf.context.end event to save the profile run
    - if it is configured to, it will output a link to the run.
